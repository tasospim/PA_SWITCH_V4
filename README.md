Almost everything in our life starts with a story. So here too behind this work, there is a story. 

In 1993, my professional journey into the world of security systems began. 
An era completely different from today where security systems were in their first stage and the technology 
they used was comparable to that era (Photo Bellow)

Over the years, these also followed the rapid development of technology, reaching today. 
Unfortunately, the safety of people had the opposite route than the technology had.
Since 2007 I have been noticing some burglary incidents in the news where thieves broke into homes while the residents were inside with unforeseen consequences for the residents as well as the thieves. In many of these cases the residents were elderly. 

The security systems of that era start to become complex and difficult to use for these people but also for those who are not familiar with the technology. Also, many of them, at least in my country, could not afford it to acquire such a security system. 

This is how the idea was born to create a security system that will have as a prerequisite the ease of use but also the low cost, so that they have the possibility to install it in their home. 

Another important factor for this project is the technician who will undertake to install this security system, and for me personally it is the most important. Because he is the one who will give life to this work and the one who will fulfill all of it chain from theory to practice. 
For this reason, another condition for me was the ease of use and installation of the system, as well as respect for the way of work that the installer will need to implement. 

This project was first created in 2011 and after some improvements it reached the current level. My purpose as the creator of this project is to make this product available and reach the homes of people who need it. 

Note: The project as presented has already been tested and installed on many of my friends and relatives from 2011 until today Febraury 2026. Also it is a project that I have loved, it is alive and constantly evolving following new technologies. I will try my best to support this project by giving all necessary information for my work. 

Thanks for taking the time to read these words.
With regards and love:
